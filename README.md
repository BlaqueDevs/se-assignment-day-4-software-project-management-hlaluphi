## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

Delivering software projects on time is important to keep clients happy and stay ahead of competitors which is why you need to be realistic when estimating/alocating time frame to determine duration of the project. 
Project managers can achieve this by planning well, communicating clearly and handling any issues that might affect the project quickly to avoid exceeding due date.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

Keeping costs under control helps a software project succeed by keeping the cost within the client’s budget constraint and not overspend which if not taken care of might inconvenience the client and put a strain on a client's budget. 
Project managers can prevent budget overruns by planning carefully, tracking spending and adjusting plans to avoid overspending.
